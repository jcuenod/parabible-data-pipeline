This is a project to stitch together various versification alignments that we have scattered around. Right now, it depends on:

 - `parabible/bhs-lxx-alignment-modified-output.json` - parallel alignment derived from old work on the Verity Project subsequently merged with old work from Stead's Biblecrawler for Parabible. Some of this work was manually edited along the way so it's not easy to regenerate.
 - `biblecrawler/alignment.db` - Newer work extracting data from Biblecrawler. There were issues lining up my LXX data with the versification in here, though.
