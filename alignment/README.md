# Alignment Data

Right now it seems that our best bet is to use the STEPBible data. It provides a verse-by-verse mapping between the NRSV (?) and the "original". This means more work will need to be done to map the LXX (and JPS) but some of that data is in the repo (we'll just have to parse it and one of the advantages of this `.ods` was that it wouldn't require much work to transform).
