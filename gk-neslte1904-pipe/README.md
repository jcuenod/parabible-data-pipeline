## Content

### Nestle 1904

A version of the GNT used because it is old enough to be in the public domain. Has a lot of data built on it (e.g. comparisons to NA26/7/8). See, particularly, `/morph` for CSV data.

> The text has been augmented with morphological tags, lemmatization, and Strong's numbers by Dr. Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen of Scripture Systems, Denmark.

### Enrichments

 - **Syntax Trees**: Part of the repo in xml format but not yet usable in parabible-like searches because they have too much nesting)
 - **Glosses**: Also in the repo (I haven't looked at how to include them). Note also, dictionaries by Dodson and Mounce can probably be mapped to Nestle1904 using strongs numbers.
