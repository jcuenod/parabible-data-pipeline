### Rahlfs LXX

> Septuaginta, ed. A. Rahlfs (Stuttgart: WÅ¸rttembergische Bibelanstalt, 1935; repr. in 9th ed., 1971).
> <http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/0-readme.txt>

Abbreviations:

 - **CCAT**: Center for Computer Analysis of Texts
 - **CATSS**: Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint/Scriptural Study (cf. <http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rak//catss.html>)

The CATSS data includes *parsing* and *lemmatisation* for Rahlf's LXX text. There are (a lot of) mistakes in CATSS data. It is worth trying to fix as many of them as possible augmenting with James Tauber's work... 

### Enrichments

 - Normalised Lemmas (to cross-search the NT)
 - Glosses (should these be normalised too, if possible?)
