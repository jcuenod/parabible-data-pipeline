# WIP: Swete LXX

The content right now was an initial attempt at alignment to Rahlfs LXX but glancing over it I realise the differences involve non-trivial variation. So I'm abandoning this project for a while (I hope that <https://greek-learner-texts.org/texts/> will get us there cf. work by @sleeptillseven: <https://github.com/sleeptillseven/LXX-Swete/>)
