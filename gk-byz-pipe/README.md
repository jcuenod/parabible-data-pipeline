### Byzantine Majority Text

This is Robinson's critical edition of the Byzantine majority text (NT) with parsing released to the public domain.

In addition to files with parsing and strongs numbers, there is:

> A "text only" version in something akin to BETA Code, accents, breathings, diarheses, iota subscripts, Byzantine variants, and a Nestle-Aland 27 collation.
>
> <https://github.com/byztxt/byzantine-majority-text>

These sets of files appear to be in different (custom) formats and will need to be separately processed. Note, especially, the fact that "**Byzantine variants**" are noted.

Latest update is that they have utf8 csv files in https://github.com/byztxt/byzantine-majority-text/tree/master/csv-unicode

Check the with-variants data. Looks like it has good stuff!
